### flex-direction: row-reverse & column-reverse

### simple flexing
flex-warp:wrap; // container
flex:200px; // items

 sets minimum width of items as 200px. Items can grow to fill the container. It is however totally different from setting minimum-width.

### Shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap;
 flex-flow:row wrap;

### Flexible sizing; 
flex: 1 200px; // to the items

flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shirnk and flex-basis. Flex grow and shrink are unitless however flex-basis is width units like px etc.

### ordering flex items

button:nth-of-type(3){
    order:1;
}

By default, all flex items have an order value of 0.
button:last-child {
  order: -1; // negative values are possible
}

### auto sizing
flex-flow:1 auto; // items
here flex-basis is auto
